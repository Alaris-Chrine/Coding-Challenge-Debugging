# Coding-Challenge-Debugging

They wanted me to create a Redis simulator; this code contains an input loop menu with the SET and GET commands mostly implemented (in redis.cpp), but my hash table (in hash.cpp) is getting errors.

The commands I have implemented are:

SET key value

GET key

EXIT

(arguments for the commands are separated by spaces)
